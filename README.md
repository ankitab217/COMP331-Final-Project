**Student:** [Your Name]  
**Course:** COMP/STAT 331 - Data Quality Management  
**Semester:** Fall 2025  
**Institution:** University of the Fraser Valley

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes data quality issues in an e-commerce retail transaction dataset containing 541,909 records. The analysis identifies critical quality problems affecting customer analytics, revenue forecasting, and machine learning model fairness.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

Apply data quality concepts from Week 10-11 lectures (Data Warehousing and Data Mining) to:
- Identify completeness, validity, and consistency issues
- Analyze impact on business intelligence and ML applications
- Propose actionable recommendations aligned with CRISP-DM framework

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. **Completeness Issue - Missing CustomerID**
- **Problem:** 135,080 transactions (24.93%) lack CustomerID
- **Impact:** Breaks customer segmentation, RFM analysis, recommendation systems
- **Root Cause:** Guest checkout not properly tracked

### 2. **Validity Issue - Invalid Values**
- **Problem:** 10,624 negative quantities; 2,517 invalid prices
- **Impact:** Revenue calculations incorrect; ML models learn wrong patterns
- **Root Cause:** Returns not flagged separately from sales

### 3. **Consistency & Bias Issue - Geographic Concentration**
- **Problem:** 91.4% of transactions from United Kingdom only
- **Impact:** ML models biased toward UK customer behavior; unfair recommendations
- **Root Cause:** Sampling bias in data collection

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Environment:** Google Colab
- **Dataset:** E-commerce Online Retail Data (UCI-inspired)

## 📈 Data Quality Dimensions Analyzed

| Dimension | Issue Found | Severity |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Completeness** | 25% missing CustomerID | 🔴 Critical |
| **Validity** | Negative quantities/prices | 🟠 High |
| **Consistency** | Geographic bias (91% UK) | 🔴 Critical |

---

## 💡 Recommendations (Prioritized)

1. **P0 - Immediate:** Implement CustomerID completeness strategy
2. **P0 - Immediate:** Standardize returns processing (flag vs. negative values)
3. **P0 - Immediate:** Mitigate geographic bias through stratified sampling
4. **P1 - 3 months:** Deploy automated DQ monitoring dashboard
5. **P1 - 3 months:** Establish data governance framework

## 🎓 Course Connections

### Week 10 - Data Warehousing
- ETL quality checks in Transform phase
- Referential integrity (missing foreign keys break star schema)
- Slowly Changing Dimensions for customer tracking

### Week 11 - Data Mining & Ethics
- CRISP-DM: 50% effort on Data Preparation (validated!)
- Bias detection and fairness in ML models
- Feature engineering (transform negative values into categorical)
